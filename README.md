# Minesweeper NG Field Generator

## In Work

- dont restart completely when changing a part, make a 5x5 matrix around as hidden
- implement single island changer
- allow inaccessible parts be completely filled with mines or completely empty, the field just has to be solvable
- new algorithm which gets all disjunct border fields instead of the islands for the permutation checks
- write tests for all patterns for the respective solving steps
- finish standalone executables for generating multiple fields and save them
- add linux 64 & 32 builds to github action
- enum for Solving Steps for better understanding of the solving steps
- solver / ng generator output % of solved parts of field
